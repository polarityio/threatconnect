ThreatConnect is a security operations and analytics platform designed to allow teams to identify, manage, and block threats faster with intelligence.  For more information about ThreatConnect please visit:

The Polarity ThreatConnect integration allows Polarity to search for address, file, host, and email indicators in ThreatConnect.  The Polarity-ThreatConnect integrations includes interactive elements that allow Polarity user's to add and remove tags, modify the severity and confidence level of an indicator, and report false positives directly from the Polarity Overlay Window.

## ThreatConnect Integration Options

### ThreatConnect Instance URL

The URL of the ThreatConnect instance you would like to connect to (including http:// or https://).  If you are running an internal instance of ThreatConnect on a non-default port, please specify the port here as well.

### Access ID

Account Identifier that is associated with the API Key

### API Key

The API (secret) Key associated with the provided Access ID

### Organization Search Blocklist

By default all organizations visible to the provided API User will be searched. This blocklist is a comma delimited list of organizations you do not want searched. This option cannot be used in conjunction with the "Organization Search Allowlist" option.

### Organization Search Allowlist 

By default all organizations visible to the provided API User will be searched. This whitelist is a comma delimited list of organizations you want searched (organizations not listed will not be searched). This option cannot be used in conjunction with the "Organization Search Blocklist" option

> Note that you cannot use both the Organization Search Allowlist and the Organization Search Blocklist.  

## Custom Ports

If your ThreatConnect instance is running on a custom port you will need to modify the `settings.threatConnectPort` property in the integration's `config.js` file:

```
vi /app/polarity-server/integrations/threatconnect/config/config.js
```

Find the property `settings.threatConnectPort` and set it to the proper port:

```
{
  settings: {
    threatConnectPort: 8443
  }
}
```

If you are using the default port (443) then you so not need to modify this setting.  This setting is required to rewrite all the links returns by the ThreatConnect REST API.  Without this setting, all external links within the integration will go to the default port of 443.

## Installation Instructions

Installation instructions for integrations are provided on the [PolarityIO GitHub Page](https://polarityio.github.io/).
